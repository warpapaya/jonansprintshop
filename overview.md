Jonan's Print Shop

‚∏ª

üß≠ Overview

The Jonan's Print Shop is a self-hosted, dockerized web app that allows a local vendor to submit orders for 3D-printed clay cutters and lets Jonan manage them efficiently. The goal is to replace text message coordination with a clean web-based workflow.

The system must be zero-cost to host, run fully within Petie‚Äôs existing Docker infrastructure, and integrate with external automation via webhooks instead of SaaS dependencies.

‚∏ª

üéØ Goals
	‚Ä¢	Eliminate back-and-forth text messaging between vendor and parents.
	‚Ä¢	Give Jonan a clear, simple dashboard for managing active and completed orders.
	‚Ä¢	Allow the vendor to submit new orders with attachments and receive status updates automatically.
	‚Ä¢	Send notifications via webhooks to external systems for flexible automation (e.g., email/SMS).
	‚Ä¢	Keep deployment lightweight, local, and dependency-free.

üß± Core Features

1. Order Creation (Vendor)
	‚Ä¢	Simple web form for submitting orders:
	‚Ä¢	Item name
	‚Ä¢	Quantity
	‚Ä¢	Color/material (optional)
	‚Ä¢	Notes
	‚Ä¢	Preferred completion/pickup date
	‚Ä¢	File uploads (.stl, .3mf, .zip, .png, .jpg)
	‚Ä¢	Displays confirmation message and order ID on success.
	‚Ä¢	Submissions create a new record and emit a order.created webhook event.

2. Dashboard (Jonan)
	‚Ä¢	Kanban or list-style dashboard with the following statuses:
	‚Ä¢	new ‚Üí prepping ‚Üí printing ‚Üí finished ‚Üí ready ‚Üí delivered ‚Üí archived
	‚Ä¢	Click to view full order details:
	‚Ä¢	Files, notes, vendor info, history timeline
	‚Ä¢	Buttons for updating status, uploading completion photos, and setting pickup times
	‚Ä¢	Each change emits a webhook event (e.g., order.status.changed, order.ready).

3. Pickup Coordination
	‚Ä¢	Configurable pickup windows defined by admin (e.g., Tue/Thu 3‚Äì5 PM).
	‚Ä¢	When Jonan marks an order ‚Äúready,‚Äù the vendor receives a webhook-triggered link to confirm a pickup time.
	‚Ä¢	Once confirmed, a pickup.confirmed webhook is sent.

4. Attachments
	‚Ä¢	Files stored on local volume (/data/uploads).
	‚Ä¢	Basic whitelist validation for file types.
	‚Ä¢	Optional ClamAV container for malware scanning.
	‚Ä¢	Thumbnail generation for image files (optional phase 2).

5. Webhook System
	‚Ä¢	Configurable via admin UI.
	‚Ä¢	Supports multiple endpoints.
